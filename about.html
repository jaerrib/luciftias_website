            <h1>Who, what, and why...</h1>
            <p>
                <h2>The TLDR answer:</h2>
                <strong>Luciftias</strong> is an experimental ambient/drone project from Meadville, Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>The full story:</h2>
                <strong>Luciftias</strong> formed in 2000 as a side project of the black metal band, <strong>Vukodlak</strong>. <em>Conceptually</em>, however, it dates to a handful of noise recordings I made in the summer of 1993. Back then, living in a small town in the pre-Internet days, I didn't know what noise, ambient, or experimental music was. I just rested my guitar against a pair of hightop sneakers so that it would create feedback from my little Fender practice amp and twiddled the knobs of various effect pedals and captured the magic with a Kmart microphone and a portable tapedeck.

                But the <em>real</em> origin goes back further, even before I ever picked up a musical instrument. Between the ages of 2 and 7, my bedroom shared a wall with my family's washing machine and dryer. The sound was soothing and put me to sleep. Likewise, I found solace in the ambience of rain hitting the metal roof of our mobile home and the drone of the Interstate highway as I laid down in the back of our station wagon on the way home from my grandparents' house in Ohio.

                It's only in hindsight did I put these influences together with why I am drawn to tones and textures. A lot of the music I've done outside Luciftias has been rock and metal oriented. I had always considered myself to be a "metal guitar player", gravitating towards the bands I grew up with: Kiss, Black Sabbath, Metallica, etc. At a certain point, black metal became the subgenre of metal that resonated the most with me. Maybe it was the emphasis on <em>feeling</em> over technique, maybe it was the absolute catharsis I felt when trem picking at those faster tempos, or maybe it was the beauty I found in its darkness. So I shifted gears from playing thrash and "classic metal" and devoted myself to pursuing what became <strong>Vukodlak</strong>.

                The late 90s were a great time for the Internet. It was like an electronic frontier, and all of a sudden, musicians started having more of an online presence. I recall the first time I uploaded a RealAudio file so that visitors could listen to that initial <strong>Vukodlak</strong> recording: rough, lo-fi, and glorious. I also remember getting ahold of new music via Napster and Mp3.com. I absorbed it all, delving into the most obscure music I could find. That's when I discovered that other people were doing the type of experientation I did back in high school. Noise. I first heard NON's "Total War" as an Acheron cover. I was in contact with Vincent Crowley as I was helping Acheron with their website. He pointed me in the direction of the original, and I embarked down another rabbit hole. I quickly started to emulate this style in earnest, and <strong>Luciftias</strong> was born! As stated above, it was just supposed to be a one-off side project. I even credited myself as <em>Lord Akhkharu</em> (the pseudonymn I adopted with <strong>Vukodlak</strong>) and a track from the <em>Via Diabolis</em> demo ("Nowonmai") ended up on that first album.

                Material came slowly over the next few years. 2003 saw an appearance on the <em>Grain</em> compilation and a re-release of <em>Suspension of Disbelief</em>, and an ill-fated split with <strong>Vomit Orchestra</strong> ended up with my half being released as <em>Darkness Absolute</em> in 2006. It was this timeframe though that several seeds were planted which impacted the direction I would eventually take. First, I was introduced to drone doom via Sunn O))). The results of that can be heard on <em>The Great Gray Beast</em> and <em>Christeos Luciftias</em>. The second was the <strong>Argedco Dosig g Manin</strong> project with my cousin, which involved a great amount of experimentation and files being emailed back and forth. This is where I began moving away from the earlier sound of <strong>Luciftias</strong> and towards the drones that characterize most of my work.

                By 2009, the sound I was aiming for was starting to get dialed in and my first album-length piece appeared in the form of <em>Scio Me Nihil Scire</em>. I was incorporating eBowed guitars, heavy post effects and manipulation, and brainwave synchronization into my output. This continued for a few years until, in 2014, I got an invitation to perform at an art exhibit in New York City.

                My usual modus operandi involved an extensive amount of post-production. Unfortunately, this meant that replicating those textures in a live setting would have been difficult at best. How then to achieve an ambient/drone sound without resorting to synthesizers? In the past, I had recorded tracks using an eBow, guitar and effects setup but have always incorporated many overdubs in the final version. However, by mixing this method with Robert Fripp-style delay effects, I found that I was able to build layer upon layer to approximate a similar sound. Due to scheduling issues, I was not able to perform at the exhibit. However, the thought process I went through in preparing a live performance setup was documented as <em>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</em>. From there, most of my recorded output has been focused on guitar-oriented drones which were <em>played</em> not just created through layers of manipulation.
