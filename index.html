            <p>This release is a bit unusual for two reasons. First, the tracks are generally shorter in nature than
                much of my work and second, it's an EP. The former came about quite naturally while the latter was
                suggested by the owner of Eg0cide Productions upon hearing three of the four tracks.

                I was inspired to experiment with no-input mixing after listening to various works by Failure Circle. Of
                course, the source material got the Luciftias treatment which resulted in the decidedly minimalist audio
                on the EP. The last piece to be added was created by pushing what can be done with the output from the
                <a href="https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/image2sound">image2sound</a> utility I'm developing.
