            <h2>31 Dec 2024</h2>
            <p><em>Solarispherean Mediations</em> is now available!! You can check it out now on <a
                    href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/solarispherean-meditations">Bandcamp</a>, Funkwhale
                (via <a href="https://open.audio/library/albums/21406">Open.audio</a>),
                <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/6774183cc2a5b4a42bdd365a">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/luciftias-solarispherean-meditations">Internet Archive</a>!</p>
            <p>The two tracks on this album represent the opposite ends of the spectrum for how I create. On one hand,
                there is an original, unmodified guitar improvisation inspired by tone clusters. On the other, there
                is the mutated and manipulated evolution of that recording. One captures what I played and how I felt
                at a particular time and place while the other demonstrates what happens when I let my sonic brushes
                touch the canvas. Both are inescapable parts of who I am.

            <p><em>The Day After the End of Time</em> is now available from <a href="https://eg0cide.com/">Eg0cide
                    Productions</a>! You can check it out on <a
                    href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/the-day-after-the-end-of-time">Bandcamp</a>, Funkwhale
                (via <a href="https://open.audio/library/albums/21090">Open.audio</a>), and the <a
                    href="https://archive.org/details/eg0_262">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
            <p>This is 4-track EP with a strong focus on minimalism. This time around, I was inspired to experiment with
                no-input mixing after listening to various works by Failure Circle. Of course, the source material got
                the Luciftias treatment. The last piece to be added was created by pushing what can be done with the
                output from the image2sound utility I'm developing. Ironically, this was <strong>not</strong> one of the
                planned releases I mentioned back in June so be on the lookout for more material in the near future...

            <h2>30 Jun 2024</h2>
            <p>The <a href"music.html">Music</a> page has been updated with information about a couple collaborative
                efforts with Annihilist Provisional Disorder dating back to 2013/2014 as well as a compilation
                appearance from last year.</p>
            <p>In other news, I have multiple different releases on the horizon! One is an EP of sorts featuring more
                guitar-based collaborations with my cousin, Caleb. The next builds on no-input recordings provided by
                past collaborator, Florian from <a href="https://eg0cide.com/">Eg0cide Productions</a>. Another
                incorporates a variety of techniques that hearkens back to the style of 2009's <em><a
                        href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/textures">Textures</a></em> album. Lastly, might be a
                long-delayed album-length track recorded back in 2021!</p>

            <h2>11 Nov 2022</h2>
            <p>Aside from the gradual transition from the WordPress site (<a
                    href="https://dronomancy.wordpress.com/">Dronomancy</a>) to this one here on Neocities, there are a
                few scraps of news I can share. The details are still in very sparse at best, however, I would like to
                report two collaborations are in the discussion phase. Each collaboration will be with someone with whom
                I've worked in the past. (Hint: Think <em><a
                        href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/symbiogenesis">Symbiogenesis</a></em> / <em><a
                        href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/suspended-blades">Suspended Blades</a></em> and
                <em><a href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/argedco-dosig-g-manin">Argedco Dosig g Manin</a></em>
                / <em><a href="https://luciftias.bandcamp.com/album/the-sin-of-collaboration">The Sin of
                        Collaboration</a></em>.) There's also a strong possibility of a new <strong>Luciftias</strong>
                release on <a href="https://eg0cide.com/">eg0cide</a> at some point in the future.
